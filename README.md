# Hunt the Wumpus
Microsoft high school game competition written with four other AP computer science students: Cassandra Cawley, Laurissa Lam, Marianne Li, Ivy Wang. My role was the project manager who integrated everyoneâ€™s code together. 

The goal of the game is to explore different caves and answer enough trivia questions correctly when running into the Wumpus. Some caves have different obstacles, such as poisonous bats or deep pits. The themes of the levels are Big Hero 6, Tangled, Frozen, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Wreck it Ralph. 

We had no prior experience with C# and were given a timeline of 1 to 2 months to complete the game.
